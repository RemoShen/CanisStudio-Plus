# Anthoring Data-Driven Chart Animations

introduction
----
Canis Studio Plus provides an easy access to authoring expressive chart animations especially for people who lacks programming skills. It represents the animation with the means of an intuitive visual language. And by interactively editing the visual elements, the designer can alter the animation properties. Under the keyframe-based authoring paradigm, CAST+ enables the designer to create animations in three steps: keyframe construction, keyframe sequencing and keyframe properties specification. Meanwhile, in order to improve the efficiency and rationality of the result animations, CAST+ also proposed suggestion strategies in keyframe construction and sequencing.
